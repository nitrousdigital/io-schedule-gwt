# A web-based implementation of the Google IO 2011 Schedule Application #

Google created an excellent [application](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.apps.iosched&referrer=utm_source%3Dblog%26utm_medium%3Donline%26utm_campaign%3Dio2011) to view and manage the conference schedule on Android 2.1+.
I decided to re-implement the application using GWT so that I could access the same functionality in the web browser on my iPhone.

My goal is to continue to update this project in order to replicate 100% of the android application functionality using only GWT and HTML5. This will enable iPhone users attending Google IO 2012 to enjoy the same capabilities as Android users.

This application makes use of the same live data feeds that drive the [Google IO Android application.](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.apps.iosched&referrer=utm_source%3Dblog%26utm_medium%3Donline%26utm_campaign%3Dio2011)

A live instance of this application can be found [here](http://io2011schedule.appspot.com/#home).
