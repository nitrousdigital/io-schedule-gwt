###A web-based implementation of the Google I/O 2011 Schedule Application
Google created an Android application to enable conference attendees to view and manage their conference schedule on Android 2.1+ devices.
I decided to re-implement the application using GWT so that I could access the same functionality in a web browser on my iPhone.

This application makes use of the same live data feeds that drive the Google I/O Android application.

A live instance of this application can be found [here](https://io2011schedule-hrd.appspot.com/?offline=1#home).
